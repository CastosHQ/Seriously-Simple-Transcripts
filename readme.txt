Add downloadable transcripts to your Seriously Simple Podcasting episodes.

== Description ==

> This plugin is an add-on for [Seriously Simple Podcasting](https://www.seriouslysimplepodcasting.com/) and requires at least **v1.14.8** of Seriously Simple Podcasting in order to work.

Seriously Simple Podcasting is great for getting your audio (or video) content out there and making it available for everyone to find, but often you want to add that little bit of extra value for your listeners by supplying them with a written transcript of your episodes. Sure - you can do this by pasting all the text in your episode content, or adding a manual link in there, but a more automated and altogether cleaner option would be really great. That is exactly what this plugin provides.

Simply upload your transcript file (in any format) just like you would upload your podcast audio/video file and the link to download the transcript will appear underneath the episode media player with the rest of your episode details.

**Primary Features**

- Adds a new file upload field to your episodes for adding your transcript file
- Adds a 'Download transcript' link alongside the rest of the episode details on your episodes
