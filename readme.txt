Add downloadable transcripts to your Seriously Simple Podcasting episodes.

== Description ==

> This plugin is an add-on for [Seriously Simple Podcasting](https://www.seriouslysimplepodcasting.com/) and requires at least **v1.14.8** of Seriously Simple Podcasting in order to work.

Seriously Simple Podcasting is great for getting your audio (or video) content out there and making it available for everyone to find, but often you want to add that little bit of extra value for your listeners by supplying them with a written transcript of your episodes. Sure - you can do this by pasting all the text in your episode content, or adding a manual link in there, but a more automated and altogether cleaner option would be really great. That is exactly what this plugin provides.

Simply upload your transcript file (in any format) just like you would upload your podcast audio/video file and the link to download the transcript will appear underneath the episode media player with the rest of your episode details.

** Primary Seriously Simple Transcripts Add-On Features **

- Adds a new file upload field to your episodes for adding your transcript file
- Adds a 'Download transcript' link alongside the rest of the episode details on your episodes
- Adds a Gutenberg 'Transcripts' block
- Adds an Elementor 'Transcripts' block
- Adds a podcast:transcript tag to podcast RSS feeds

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version of Seriously Simple Podcasting does this plugin require? =

In order to use this plugin you need to have at least v1.14.8 of [Seriously Simple Podcasting](https://www.seriouslysimplepodcasting.com/). If you do not have Seriously Simple Podcasting active or you are using a version older than v1.14.8 then this plugin will do nothing.

= What if I only want the 'Download transcript' link to appear for some episodes, but not others? =

The 'Download transcript' link will only appear on episodes to which you have uploaded a transcript file. If you don't upload a file then the link will not appear.

= What file formats can I use for my transcript files? =

While PDF would be the most common file format for this kind of thing, you can upload absolutely any type of file that you like.

= What if I host my transcript files on a different server and not inside my WordPress installation? =

The transcript file works in exactly the same way as the podcast audio/video file - if you aren't uploading it directly to your WordPress site, then all you need to do is paste the URL of the file into the 'Transcript file' field when editing your episode.
